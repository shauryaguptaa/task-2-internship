          <p>
            <b>Jeffrey Preston Bezos </b> born 12 January 1964, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States 
            is an American entrepreneur who played a key role in the growth of e-commerce as the founder 
            and chief executive officer of Amazon.com, Inc., an online merchant of books and later of a 
            wide variety of products. Completed his education from Miami Palmetto Senior High School 
            (Miami, Florida) and Princeton University (B.S., 1986). Under his guidance, Amazon became the 
            largest retailer on the World Wide Web and the model for Internet sales.As more companies
            battled for Internet dollars,Bezos saw the need to diversify, and by 2005 Amazon offered a vast 
            array of products, including consumer electronics, apparel, and hardware. While still in high 
            school, Bezos developed the Dream Institute, a centre that promoted creative thinking in young 
            students.  The company posted its first quarterly profit in January 2002. In 2007 it released a 
            portable wireless electronic reading device called the Kindle, which proved incredibly popular. 
            In 2013 Bezos acquired The Washington Post and affiliated publications.
